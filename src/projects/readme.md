# Go projects

1. [cards](/src/projects/01_cards) - Simple project that facilitates creating a deck of cards, saving to file, loading from file and shuffling an abstract type that sits over a slice of strings.

2. [structs](/src/projects/02_structs) - trivial project demonstrating structs, nested structs and simple pointer examples.

3. [maps](/src/projects/03_maps) - Strictly speaking more of a syntactic user demo than a project. Simple exporation of declaration of maps. Will be removed to the language coverage in a later commit / refactor

4. [interfaces](/src/projects/04_interfaces) - Another syntax an concept introduction project as opposed to an actual project. Again, this will be moved to a language concepts part of the repo structure at a later stage

5. [http and Reader interfaces](/src/projects/05_http_interfaces) - Small http based get request project to demonstrate the power of the Reader interface in Go.
