# Go projects

1. [cards](https://github.com/irisida/golang/tree/master/projects/01_cards) - Simple project that facilitates creating a deck of cards, saving to file, loading from file and shuffling an abstract type that sits over a slice of strings.

2. [structs](https://github.com/irisida/golang/tree/master/projects/02_structs) - trivial project demonstrating structs, nested structs and simple pointer examples.

3. [maps](https://github.com/irisida/golang/tree/master/projects/03_maps) - Strictly speaking more of a syntactic user demo than a project. Simple exporation of declaration of maps. Will be removed to the language coverage in a later commit / refactor
