# Installation and setup common best practice

- Install golang for your system from [here](https://golang.org/)
- Set the GOPATH to `Users/username/go`
- Within the GOPATH directory create three subdirectories, `bin`, `pkg` & `src`
- within the `src` directory create a `github.com` directory and your GH username as a child of that. From within that child directory you will create and store your Go projects.
