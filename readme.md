# Go. What is it?

How do you start learning a programming language? ..or a new programming language? That's pretty much what I'm going to try to cover in this repository. It will be a mix of code snippets, little trivial mini-projects and readmes. I'll probably tart some of it out as blog posts with snatched and butchered ideas twisted to my own amusement in the pursuit of learning to program in `Go`.
